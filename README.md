# superpixel_image_stitching
In this paper, the image is spliced based on super pixel.
## Introduction
Super - pixel - based fast image stitching code implementation. We take the superpixel as the alignment unit and separately calculate the mapping transformation matrix of each superpixel. With the same alignment effect as APAP, we can greatly reduce the time of image stitching.<br>
## Requirements
Our program runs on windows8.1. Compile and run with Visual Studio 2015. You need three external dependencies to help you compile and run the code. The three external dependency libraries are:opencv3.3.0„ÄÅEigen3 and TinyVLib.<br>
